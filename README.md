# Company-Expansion-Analysis
As ABC Company prepares for expansion, a strategic analysis of its product performance is critical to understanding what has worked historically and where opportunities for growth lie. This executive summary highlights the process and findings from a detailed Power BI analysis of product-related data, focusing on Cost, Revenue, and Profit across Years and Order Method types.

The data set provided included over 84,000 retail sales records. The first step involved cleaning the data by removing null and zero-revenue rows and formatting all monetary values as currency. Once cleaned, the dataset was loaded into Microsoft Power BI, where multiple dashboards were created to visualize trends, performance, and opportunities.

The visuals were organized into three key themes:

•	Revenue Trends: A line chart displayed total revenue growth from 2004 to 2006, followed by a dip in 2007. A stacked column chart further revealed that Web and Sales Visit were the most successful order methods contributing to revenue. A horizontal bar chart identified Star Lite and Zone as the top-selling products.

•	Cost Analysis: Product cost followed a similar pattern, peaking in 2006. A treemap and donut chart showed that Personal Accessories and Camping Equipment were the most cost-intensive product lines. Bar charts by product type provided additional clarity on average cost distribution.

•	Profitability Insights: Profit trends mirrored revenue, with 2006 again emerging as the strongest year. Eyewear and Watches led in gross profit by product type. A 100% stacked column chart showed the consistency of profit share across order methods.

These visualizations offer stakeholders a clear, data-driven narrative: 2006 was the company’s most profitable year, and certain product categories and order methods significantly outperformed others. Based on this analysis, ABC Company should focus its expansion on high-margin categories such as Eyewear and Watches, and invest in effective order channels like Web and Sales Visits.
This report not only answers critical business questions but also provides a framework for ongoing analysis. By leveraging Power BI, ABC Company can continuously monitor performance, adapt strategies, and drive sustainable growth during its expansion.
